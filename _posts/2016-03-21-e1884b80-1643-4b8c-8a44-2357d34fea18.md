Cupcakes are a great alternative if you don't fancy making a whole cake, and these Easter bunny cupcakes will be sure to put a smile on anyone's face.
Choose your favourite sponge flavour to form the base of your cupcake, then top with some scrummy buttercream. Add your sugarcrafted bunny bum complete with cute fluffy tail, and a few sugar carrot decorations for good measure, then stand back and admire your handiwork!
